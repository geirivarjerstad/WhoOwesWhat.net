# WhoOwesWhat.net
ServiceStack server for the WhoOwesWhat-Ionic hybrid app

##How to run
- It works out of the box. Just download and open with Visual Studio
- Compile and run

If a MSSQL server is installed, it will create a empty database for the application.
The ServiceStack server is configured to work with CORS so that mobile app can talk to the server using XHR requests. The solution is also ready to publish directly to Azure website. (with your own profile)
